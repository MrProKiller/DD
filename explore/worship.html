      <strong><h1>Place of Worship</h1></strong>
      <p>Worship in the gurdwara takes place in a hall called a diwan,
        meaning 'court of a ruler'. <br><br> Each morning the Guru Granth Sahib
         is carried in procession into the diwan and placed on a takht,
         a raised platform with a canopy over it to show that is the ruler
          of the Sikhs. <br> <br> The Guru Granth Sahib is covered with beautiful cloths
           called rumalas. An attendant waves a decorative fan, called a chauri,
            over it to purify the area before reading the scripture. <br><br> Sikhs
            remove their shoes, cover their heads and bow before the Guru
            Granth Sahib when they enter the room. They make an offering of
             money or food for the Gurdwara's kitchen, which is known as the langar. <br><br>
              Everyone sits on the floor, men on one side, women on the other. Services
               are informal and may last a long time, so people come in and out as they wish.</p>
        <h1 style="margin-top:10%;">Waheguru</h1>
        <p>The main purpose of worship is to praise the one, true God, referred to as Waheguru.
           According to Sikh belief, God is the creator of everything, is immortal and is without form. <br><br>
            The Mool Mantar, the opening sentence of the Guru Granth Sahib, contains Guru Nanak's teaching
             about God and is recited daily in morning prayer. <br><br> Because God has no form, Sikhs do not have
              images of God in their place of worship, the gurdwara. Sikhs do have pictures of holy people,
               eg Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. However, they do not worship the Gurus. Rather, in public
                worship they remember the Gurus, listen to their teachings and share food, reinforcing the equality of all.</p>
